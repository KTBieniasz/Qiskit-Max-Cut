# Qiskit-Max-Cut
This is a solution of the Max-Cut problem, employing Qiskit to implement a VQE solution for a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).
The notebook contains an extended problem statement and discussion of the methods, as well as a fully working implementation with simple optimizations.

Developed as part of an application for [CDL Quantum Stream](https://creativedestructionlab.com/streams/quantum/) in 2021.
